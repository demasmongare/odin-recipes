        <h4>How to Make Rotisserie Chicken Step-By-Step</h4>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make rotisserie chicken:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Season chicken cavity with a pinch of salt. Tie legs together with kitchen string; then tie wings to the bird. Secure
            chicken on a rotisserie attachment.
</li>
            <li>Place rotisserie over the preheated grill and cook for 10 minutes.
</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, quickly mix together butter, 1 tablespoon of salt, paprika, and pepper. Turn the grill down to medium and
            baste chicken with butter mixture.
</li>
            <li>Close the lid and cook over medium heat, basting occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and the internal
            temperature reaches 180 degrees F (83 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the rotisserie and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.
